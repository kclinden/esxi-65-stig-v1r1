  title "The ESXi Image Profile and VIB Acceptance Levels must be verified."
  desc  "Verify the ESXi Image Profile to only allow signed VIBs.  An unsigned
VIB represents untested code installed on an ESXi host.  The ESXi Image profile
supports four acceptance levels:

    (1) VMwareCertified - VIBs created, tested and signed by VMware
    (2) VMwareAccepted - VIBs created by a VMware partner but tested and signed
by VMware,
    (3) PartnerSupported - VIBs created, tested and signed by a certified
VMware partner
    (4) CommunitySupported - VIBs that have not been tested by VMware or a
VMware partner.

    Community Supported VIBs are not supported and do not have a digital
signature.  To protect the security and integrity of your ESXi hosts do not
allow unsigned (CommunitySupported) VIBs to be installed on your hosts.
